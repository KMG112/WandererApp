# Endless Wander

Endless Wander is a crowed sourced choose your own adventure story. During SXSW in March of 2018: participants would click start, and be given a random chapter to read along with two possible prompts to build their own chapter off of. That participant would then chose one of the prompts, and write a new chapter based off of that prompt. They would then write two new prompts for the next user.
